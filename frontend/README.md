##Technology stack: JavaScript (JS), React, Redux Toolkit (RTK), RTK Query, React Router DOM, Material-UI (MUI), and CSS Modules.
Before running the project, navigate to the frontend folder by typing this command in your local terminal: cd frontend. Next, install the node and npm dependencies. Then, in the local terminal, enter the command npm i.
After installation, a folder called node_modules will be created. This is where all the installed third-party packages will be stored.
To run the project, write the command npm run dev in the terminal. If everything works correctly, you will see the link "Local: http://localhost:5173/" (the last digit may be different, but that is normal). Click on the link with the left mouse button, and you will be taken to a browser where you can test the online store.
